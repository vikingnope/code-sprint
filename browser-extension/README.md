## Troubleshooting

### Extension Shows "Dashboard Disconnected"

If the extension shows "Dashboard Disconnected" even when you're on the Spendy dashboard:

1. **Check the URL**
   - Make sure you're on `http://localhost:5173` (or your app's URL)
   - The extension looks for specific URL patterns like `localhost:5173`, `localhost:3000`

2. **Refresh the Page**
   - After installing the extension, refresh the dashboard page
   - The content script needs to load after the page is ready

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for "Spendy Extension" messages in the Console tab
   - Check for any error messages that might indicate issues

4. **Verify Extension is Active**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Make sure "Spendy Transaction Alerts" is enabled
   - Check for any error messages in the extension details

5. **Manual Detection Test**
   - Open the extension popup
   - Check if the connection status updates after a few seconds
   - Try clicking the "Send Sample Alert" button to test functionality

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check Extension Status**
   - Ensure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
   - Check for any error messages in the extension details

2. **Verify Dashboard Connection**
   - Make sure you're on the Spendy dashboard
   - Check that the popup shows "Dashboard Connected"

3. **Test Notifications**
   - Try the "Send Sample Alert" button
   - Check if browser notifications are enabled for your browser

### No Browser Notifications Appearing

If you're not seeing **pop-up notifications** from your browser/OS:

1. **First Time Setup - Request Permissions**
   - Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
   - Click "Send Sample Alert" button
   - **This will trigger the permission request**
   - Look for a notification permission prompt from your browser
   - Click "Allow" when prompted

2. **If No Permission Prompt Appears**
   - Go to `chrome://settings/content/notifications`
   - Look for "localhost:5173" or your site in the blocked list
   - If found, click the trash icon to remove it
   - Try the "Send Sample Alert" button again

3. **Manual Permission Check**
   - Right-click the extension icon â†’ "Manage extensions"
   - Look for "Site access" section
   - Make sure the extension has access to your site
   - Check that "Notifications" is listed in permissions

4. **Alternative Permission Method**
   - Visit your dashboard at `localhost:5173`
   - Look for a ðŸ”” icon in the address bar
   - Click it and select "Allow" for notifications
   - Refresh the page and try the extension again

5. **Test Notifications**
   - Click the extension icon and use "Send Sample Alert"
   - You should see a **system notification** pop up, not just text in the popup
   - Check the browser console for any error messages

6. **Check OS Notification Settings**
   - **Windows**: Settings > System > Notifications & actions
   - **macOS**: System Preferences > Notifications > Chrome
   - **Linux**: Check your desktop environment's notification settings
