# Spendy

A modern personal finance tracking application built with React and Vite.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Features To-Do

### M1 Expense Tracking & Visualization

- [x] M1.1 Present a clear view of a user's past three months of expenses. You have been provided with mock data for this.
- [x] M1.2 Categorise spending into buckets (e.g. food, rent, transport, subscriptions).
- [x] M1.3 Visualising spending (including trends) using charts/graphs.

### M2 Savings Goal Engine

- [ ] M2.1 Allow users to set one or more savings goals (e.g. vacation, emergency funds).
- [ ] M2.2 Automatically suggest how much a user could save per month, based on their spending patterns.
- [ ] M2.3 Provide a recommendation engine that suggest areas to cut back on (e.g. "Reducing your delivery food spend by 15% could save you â‚¬100/month")
